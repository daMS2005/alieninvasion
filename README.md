# Alien Invasion

Our approach to the classic retro game Space Invaders.

## Introduction

Alien Invasion is a thrilling and challenging arcade game where players control a spaceship to fend off waves of invading aliens. Featuring modern mechanics, dynamic animations, and an immersive soundtrack.

## Features

- **Player Control:** Move the spaceship using arrow keys and fire projectiles with the spacebar.
- **Dynamic Aliens:** Aliens of various types (Blue, Yellow, Green, and UFO) with distinct behaviors.
- **Health System:** Lose health when aliens reach the bottom or collide with the player.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for each alien destroyed. Compete to beat the highest score!
- **Skins:** Choose from a variety of custom spaceship designs by renowned designer Pietro Rodrigano.
- **Music and Sounds:** Featuring an exclusive soundtrack collaboration with 50 Cent and immersive in-game sound effects.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** More aliens spawn as the score increases.
- **Leaderboard:** Store and sort the high scores.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Thorough unit tests implemented for Player, Alien, Projectile, and game logic to ensure quality and reliability.
- **Documentation:** Full project documentation, including API references and code structure, generated with Sphinx and Doxygen.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **SFML Library:** Install via Homebrew (macOS) or your package manager:
  ```bash
  brew install sfml
  ```
- **CMake:** Ensure CMake is installed:
  ```bash
  brew install cmake
  ```
- **Doxygen:** For generating code documentation:
  ```bash
  brew install doxygen
  ```
- **Sphinx:** Python-based documentation generator:
  ```bash
  pip install sphinx breathe
  ```

### Build Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd alieninvasion
```

Build the project using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./alien_invasion
```

### Run Unit Tests

After building the project, run the tests using:

```bash
./tests
```

### Generate Documentation

#### Doxygen Documentation:

Navigate to the root directory and run:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Open the generated HTML file:
```bash
open ./doxygen/html/index.html
```

#### Sphinx Documentation:

Navigate to the docs directory and run:
```bash
make html
```

Open the generated documentation:
```bash
open ./build/html/index.html
```

## How to Play

- **Objective:** Destroy as many aliens as possible while avoiding collisions. Survive as long as you can to achieve the highest score!
- **Controls:**
  - **Arrow Keys:** Move the spaceship left and right.
  - **Spacebar:** Fire projectiles.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when your health reaches zero.

## Design Choices

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Modular classes for Player, Alien, Projectile, and GameState for clean and maintainable code.
- **Dynamic Resource Management:** Efficient loading of textures and sounds ensures scalability and memory optimization.
- **Update Methods:** Centralized logic for real-time interactivity between game elements (Player, Alien, Projectile).
- **Scaling Difficulty:** Alien spawn rate increases with the score, adding replay value and challenge.
- **Documentation Tools:** Integrated Sphinx and Doxygen for professional, detailed project documentation.
